            <ol>
                <p>1. Boil water until it bubbles. The water should be very hot. This ensures the ugali will cook perfectly</p>
                <p>2. Add a cup full of flour into the water. Let it cook a few seconds until water starts to cover the flour</p>
                <p>3. Use a wooden spoon to quickly start mixing the flour and water</p>
                <p>4. Add a handful of flour and continue to mix the water and flour it will start to come together</p>
                <p>5. Reduce heat to medium and keep turning the ugali as it continues to stick together</p>
                <p>6. Gather the ugali and press it onto the side of the sufuria</p>
                <p>7. Place the wooden spoon under the ugali and form into a ball in the middle of the sufuria</p>
                <p>8. Repeat pressing the ugali on the side of the sufuria and turning it to the middle</p>
                <p>9. Once the ugali has become firm, turn it once more and smoothen it into a round. You will know your ugali is ready once you start to smell the aroma clearly,</p>
